### Machine Learning Research - Algorithms
[Project 1 An algorithm to reduce the number of features in classification using clustering of the categories of categorical predictors](https://marcelagalvisres.github.io/clustcat/)

- We significantly reduced the complexity (number of dummies to consider) of the model **60% to 95% reduction**
- Accuracy is preserved or even improved
- See publication available in [Expert Systems with Applications] (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115245/)

[Project 2 An algorithms to reduce disparate mistreatment in classification using feature shrinkage](http://example.com/)

In this project, I desgined an algorithm that enhances the trade-off between accuracy and unfairness in classification, by finding a shrunk representation of the features. 
- We optimize that trade-off using a parameter (&alpha;) that determines the weight given to Accuracy
- The main advantage of our approach is that we find a less biased representation of the data, in some cases **even reducing disparate mistreatment to zero** 
- The shrunk representation **does not harm accuracy**
- See preprint: [ResearcGate] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358614960_Improving_fairness_of_Generalized_Linear_Models_by_feature_shrinkage/)
