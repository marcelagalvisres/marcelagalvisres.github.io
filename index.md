### About my projects 

[Project 1 An algorithm to reduce the numer of features in classification using clustering of the categores of categorical predictors](https://marcelagalvisres.github.io/clustcat/)

Experimental results of our method in different datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Compared to having all categorical predictors as un-clustered dummies, we have significantly reduced the complexity of the model (95\% reduction in some cases)
\item Accuracy can be preserved or even improved
\end{itemize}
