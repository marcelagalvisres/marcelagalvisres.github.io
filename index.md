### About my projects 

[Project 1 An algorithm to reduce the numer of features in classification using clustering of the categores of categorical predictors](https://marcelagalvisres.github.io/clustcat/)

In this project I developed an algorithm that reduces the number of dummy variables to consider when working with categorical predictors in classification. The improvement achieves was tested in several real-world datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. 

- We significantly reduced the complexity of the model from **60% to 95% reduction** in the number of dummies to consider
- Accuracy is preserved or even improved

[Project 2 An algorithms to reduce disparate mistreatment in classification using feature shrinkage](http://example.com/)

In this project, I desgined an algorithm that enhances the trade-off between accuracy and unfairness in classification, by finding a shrunk representation of the features. 
- The main advantage of our approach is that we find a less biased representation of the data, in some cases even reducing disparate mistreatment to zero, 
- The shrunk representation does not harm accuracy
